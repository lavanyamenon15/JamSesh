It can lead to a conversation about the necessity of defining boundaries or criteria for decision-making when dealing with uncertainty and how different systems or individuals handle ambiguity. \n\nYou can delve into the following subtopics: \n\n1. The multiple definitions or choices that could be applicable in a specific situation. \n2. The necessity of defining criteria to evaluate choices in the presence of incomplete information.\n3. The differences in handling undefined concepts in interdisciplinary fields (e.g., mathematics, philosophy, and computer science) and the insights gained from those contrasts. \n\nThis topic can spark further discussion and exploration of the notion of the undefined, its implications, and its multifaceted nature in different knowledge areas.
